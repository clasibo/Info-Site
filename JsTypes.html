Evaluate the below comparisons:<br>
5 >= 1<br>
0 === 1<br>
4 <= 1<br>
1 != 1<br>
"A" > "B"<br>
"B" < "C"<br>

Make the string: "Hi There! It's "sunny" out" by using the + sign:<br>

	<h3> Exercise 2 </h3>

	
	<h3>Make a keyless car!</h3>
<p>This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:<br>


using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.<br><br>
IF they say they are below 18, respond with:<br>
"Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off"<br><br>

IF they say they are 18, respond with:<br>
"Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!"<br><br>

IF they say they are over 18, respond with:<br>
"Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"<br><br>
<h2> Solution - should be on the right side of the page and become vizible only when it takes an action(ex click)</h2>

<h3> Make a keyless car EVEN BETTER!</h3><br><br>
We are improving our car from previous exercise now.<br>
Solutions to future exercises will be in the .js file (meaning Javascript file) from now on.<br>

var age = prompt("What is your age?");<br><br>

if (Number(age) < 18) {<br>
	alert("Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off");<br>
} else if (Number(age) > 18) {<br>
	alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");<br>
} else if (Number(age) === 18) {<br>
	alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");<br>
}<br><br>

1. Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge().<br> Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. <br>
Use Function Declaration to create this function.<br>
Notice the benefit in having checkDriverAge() instead of copying and pasting the function everytime?<br><br>

2. Create another function that does the same thing, called checkDriverAge2() using Function Expression.<br><br>

<b>BONUS:</b> Instead of using the prompt. Now, only use console.log and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, 
so that if you enter:<br><br>
checkDriverAge(92);<br>
it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"*/<br><br>

<h2>Type Coercion </h2>
<p>
1 == '1';<br>
//console.log = true<br>

// 1 == '1' so, we have a no that is = with a text. if we use only 2 equals "==" one of them will be converted by the JS in a 
//similar type of he other. <br>
// so coercion means JS convert  acertain type to another type.<br>
1 === '1' // is false because === means that the values are same type.<br>
// coercion can be used in if statements <br>
if(1) {<br>
	console.log(5);<br>
}
console return 5 because JS convert (1) in true so it return the 5<br><br>
